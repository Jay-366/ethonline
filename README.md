# Intellitrade  
### Decentralized AI Agent Marketplace — Secure, Token-Gated Intelligence  

**Intellitrade** is a decentralized **AI Agent Marketplace** that allows developers to encrypt, package, and monetize their AI agents.  
Users can unlock these agents securely using **DataCoin-based access control**, while **cross-chain payments and settlements** are handled by the **Nexus SDK**.  
Encrypted storage, access verification, and decryption are powered by **Lighthouse IPFS**.

Built for **ETHOnline 2025**, Intellitrade demonstrates the future of decentralized, privacy-preserving AI monetization.

---

## 🚧 Problems  

- **Lack of Secure and Unified AI Agent Ecosystem** – Existing AI marketplaces expose source code and lack on-chain verification.  
- **Weak Incentives and Poor Infrastructure** – No fair reward model for developers or transparent ownership for users.  
- **Excessive Cross-Platform Gas Fee Burden** – Multiple chain interactions result in repetitive bridging and high transaction costs.  

---

## 💡 Inspiration

While exploring decentralized compute and AI frameworks, our team saw the same recurring issues:

- Creators wanted to **protect and monetize their code**.  
- Users wanted to **trust and verify** the agents they pay for.  
- Cross-chain execution remained **painful and expensive**.

So we asked:

> "What if developers could sell their AI agents like NFTs — encrypted, token-gated, and payable from any chain — all without trusting a central platform?"

That question became **Intellitrade**, a marketplace where every AI agent is a **secure, portable, and tokenized product**.

---

## 🔑 The Solution

### Encrypted Agent Deployment  
Developers package their code into **Dockerized `.tar` containers** and upload them to **Lighthouse IPFS** with full encryption.  
The encryption key is bound to a **token-based access rule** that ensures only verified owners can decrypt the file.

### Token-Gated Access (DataCoin)  
Each agent mints a **dedicated DataCoin** when listed.  
Only users who **own that specific DataCoin** can request decryption from Lighthouse — ensuring that ownership equals access.

### Cross-Chain Payments via Nexus SDK  
Users can buy access using **USDC on any supported chain**.  
The **Nexus SDK** automatically bridges funds to the developer's preferred chain and triggers the minting of the corresponding **DataCoin** through the **DataCoinVault** contract.

### Verifiable Decryption and Execution  
Once **DataCoin ownership** is verified on-chain, **Lighthouse** releases the decryption capability.  
The user can securely download and execute the agent — either locally or within the **Intellitrade runtime environment**.

## 🔄 User Flow

### 👩‍💻 Developer Flow

1. **Build the Agent**  
   Develop an AI service (Python, Node.js, etc.) and package it:
   ```bash
   docker build -t myagent .
   docker save myagent > myagent.tar
   ```

2. **Encrypt & Upload**  
   Upload via Lighthouse encrypted upload API with token-gating enabled.

3. **Set Access Condition**  
   Define `balanceOf(DataCoin, user) ≥ 1` as the unlock condition.

4. **Register on Marketplace**  
   Add metadata, price, and chain preferences through `/app/agents/create`.

---

### 🧑‍🚀 User Flow

1. Browse AI agents at `/app/marketplace`.
2. Connect wallet through `/app/wallet`.
3. Pay in USDC → Nexus SDK bridges funds automatically.
4. Vault mints the agent's DataCoin to the user.
5. Lighthouse verifies token ownership → releases decryption key.
6. User decrypts and runs the `.tar` securely on their system.

---

## 🔐 Token-Gated Decryption Proof

When the agent file is uploaded to Lighthouse, it's encrypted with a key `Kf` that's locked behind a DataCoin ownership condition.

**Flow:**
1. `CT = Encrypt(agent.tar, Kf)` → stored on IPFS.
2. `Kf` is held by Lighthouse under condition: `balanceOf(DataCoin, user) ≥ 1`.
3. On verification, Lighthouse reconstructs `Kf` using distributed key shares.
4. User decrypts the agent file locally.

Anyone without DataCoin ownership cannot recover `Kf`, ensuring code confidentiality.
