# **Avail Developer Feedback**

### **1. Inconsistent and Frequently Changing Elements Documentation**

I’ve been reading the Nexus Elements documentation daily, and I noticed that around three days ago, the documentation and component structure were changed without any notice or changelog.

This sudden update caused confusion because previous references, URLs, and installation commands (e.g., https://elements.nexus.availproject.org/r/fast-bridge.json) no longer worked.

The registry error below occurred after the change:

The item at /r/skeleton.json was not found. It may not exist at the registry.


Such frequent undocumented changes make it difficult to maintain stable local development environments.

Here is the image of installation problem while installing fast bridge component:
